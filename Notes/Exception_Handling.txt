What are the types of exceptions?
Exception can come in the following two exception classes:
	- Checked exception:
		This exception is also called as compile time exception, the compiler checks the exceptions during the 		compilation process to confirm if the exception is being handled by programmer. If not, then the exception errors 
	displays the system. Checked exception includes SQLException, ClassNotFoundException and etc.
	
	- Unchecked exception:
		Also called runtime-exception, these exceptions occur during program execution. These exceptions are 
	not checked at compile-time, so the programmer is responsible for handling these exceptions. Unchecked 		exception don't given compilation errors. Example of unchecked exceptions include NullPointerException, 		IllegalArgumentException and etc.
