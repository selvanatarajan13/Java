The fact that Henry Armstrong was buried did not seem to him to prove that he was dead:he had always been a hard man to convince.
That he really was buried, the testimony of his senses compelled him to admit.
His posture -- flat upon his back, with his hands crossed upon his stomach and tied with something that he easily broke without
profitably altering the situation -- the strict confinement of his entire person, the black darkness and profound silence,
made a body of evidence impossible to controvert and he accepted it without cavil.
